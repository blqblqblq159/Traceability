    "In contrast to the neo4j Query where we iterate over a list to do everything at once, I could not manage to do everything in a single mySQL query, and had to write an individual query for every upstream process. The mySQL queries are also far from elegant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here again, neo4j's flexibility shines through: Suppose we have an additional process upstream from the badly rated purchase that we are following (like for example the flour refinery that we mentioned earlier). All we have to do to include this process in the neo4j Query is add it to the inital UNWIND list (see neo4j query code block). Doing this in mySQL would require us to make yet another error-prone query with a ton of joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've made a comparison of neo4j and mySQL as database solutions for a fictitious traceability problem. We find that neo4j allows us to elegantly query this kind of deeply nested data, while other database solutions are significantly less flexible and more error-prone in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we showed just a couple of simple direct queries. For the more data scientifically inclined reader, there is a whole host of graph data science tools for neo4j as well: https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science-library/\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you enjoyed this short notebook showcasing some of the advantages of neo4j. If you have any questions, remarks or suggestions, I'd be delighted to hear from you at: wannes.debreuck@humain.ai"
